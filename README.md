## Server implementation

Server implementation of a randomizing facts application using MongoDB and React.

User can create, update or delete facts to be randomized by [client side](https://bad-at-naming.herokuapp.com/).

Live app can be found [here](https://punintentionally.herokuapp.com/). It might take some times for the server to wake up.
